# 426RubiksSolver
Final Project for COS 426: Computer Graphics - A WebGL Rubik's cube. 

[See it in action](https://michaelpopovici.github.io/426RubiksSolver/). It requires a WebGL-capable browser.

Features:

 * Shuffle
 * Keyboard controlled plane rotation
 * Solve (by replaying moves in reverse)
 * Different lighting models

This was a learning exercise in [Three.js](http://threejs.org/), and there are plenty of rough edges. TODO list:

 * Manually turn pieces using the mouse
 * Allow users to pre-color the Rubik's cube with a valid combination of colors
 * A general solver algorithm
 * Improved visuals of the cube
